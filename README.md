# Neural_Networks
There are 3 Business problems:
1.  concrete data: Predict strength, solved using R-neuralnet package and R-keras (functional API)
2.  50-startups dataset:  predict profit,  solved using R - neuralnet
3.  forestfires  dataset: Classify the size (and predict the area) of forest fires. Solved using
      sklearn library: MLPClassifier and MLPRegressor . Also solved using keras - sequential model
